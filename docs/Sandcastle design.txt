# Sandcastle Design Notes

I have several goals for Sandcastle, some of which may end up being in conflict with each other.

The first version of Sandcastle had the following properties:

Built entirely client-side
No database required
Entirely static files served by Apache
Supports tagging
Supports Python code snippets
Plaintext (Markup) files kept
Supports Atom feeds for blog or tag
Weak support for projects/miniprojects
Archives organized by tag
No comments

Next version of Sandcastle:

Built server-side
May possibly use a database
Dynamic pages served by Pylons/Genshi/fastcgi
Supports tagging dynamically
Versioned files
Supports color-coded Python snippets
Stores files in XHTML
Supports Atom feeds for blog, entry (comments), tag, or project
Excellent support for projects
Archives organized by tag and searchable
Comments with anti-spam technology and admin interface
